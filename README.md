## The Crux
The crux of this app is the media player and audio waveform. An audio waveform put simply is a graphic representation of the high and low frequencies throughout a song. My site, like SoundCloud, has a colored waveform overlayed on a grey waveform and the colored version covers more of the grey version as the song progresses. I initially attempted to use HTML Canvas to draw a waveform on render then if a song was played, Canvas would draw the colored version as the song went on. This proved to be quite heavy on the frontend as Canvas was continuously drawing a full image from scratch. My answer to this delimma was simple. A waveform image is drawn via Canvas when a user uploads a track and that image is saved to the database. When said track is played, an overlayed containing div with a colored version of the image has its width constantly adjusted to match the current progress in the song.

Here are some code snippets that show how the waveform works as a song is played.
```
    componentDidUpdate() {
      if (document.getElementById('myAudio') && this.props.state.session.currentSong && this.props.song && this.props.song.songUrl === this.props.state.session.currentSong.songUrl) { 
        let audioEle = document.getElementById('myAudio')
        audioEle.ontimeupdate = () => {
          this.setState({ currentTime: (audioEle.currentTime / audioEle.duration) * 100 })
          let unformattedTime = audioEle.currentTime
          let minutes = Math.floor(unformattedTime / 60 )
          let seconds 
          Math.floor(unformattedTime % 60) > 9 ? seconds = Math.floor(unformattedTime % 60) : seconds = "0" + Math.floor(unformattedTime % 60)
          let formattedTime = minutes + ":" + seconds
          this.setState({ songTime: formattedTime })
          if (audioEle.paused) {
            this.setState({playing: false})
          } else {
            this.setState({playing: true})
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    render() {
      let progressWaveForm
      if (this.props.state.session.currentSong && this.props.song.songUrl === this.props.state.session.currentSong.songUrl) {
        progressWaveForm = (
        <div className="progressWaveFormContainer" style={{ width:`${this.state.currentTime}%` }}>
          <img className="progressWaveFormImg" src={song.waveForm} />
        </div>
        )
      }
    }
    
  ```
## Usage
Using the site is straightforward and simple. You can navigate through different pages and search and listen to music without an account, but some features will not be available. To sign up, all you need to enter is an email, password, age, and a display name of your choice. Optionally, you may later enter other details about yourself such as location and name. If you just want to check out all the site has to offer without entering information, you may click "Demo Login" on the sign up/login form and you will be granted immediate user access. Along with the search feature, a great way to get started and find great tracks is to check out the discover page. There you will find what songs and artists are trending based on users' likes and recent uploads.

![AudioCloud discover page](https://github.com/Dapper-Dan/AudioCloud/blob/master/app/assets/images/WikiScreenShot3.png)

Here are some code snippets that show how the discover page sorts through tracks and artists for the site to render.
```
    getMostLiked(songs) {
        let mostLikedSongs = Object.values(songs).sort((a, b) => {
            if (Object.keys(a.likes).length > Object.keys(b.likes).length) return -1
            if (Object.keys(a.likes).length < Object.keys(b.likes).length) return 1
            if (Object.keys(a.likes).length === Object.keys(b.likes).length) return 0
        })  

        return mostLikedSongs;
    }

    getTrendingGenre(songs, genre) {
       let genreTracks = Object.values(songs).filter((song) => song.genre === genre)
       let trendingGenreTracks = this.getMostLiked(genreTracks)

       return trendingGenreTracks;
    }

    getRecentUsers(users) {
        let recentUsers = Object.values(users).sort((a, b) => {
            if (new Date(a.created_at).valueOf() > new Date(b.created_at).valueOf()) return -1
            if (new Date(a.created_at).valueOf() < new Date(b.created_at).valueOf()) return 1
            if (new Date(a.created_at).valueOf() === new Date(b.created_at).valueOf()) return 0
        })

        return recentUsers;
    }
```
